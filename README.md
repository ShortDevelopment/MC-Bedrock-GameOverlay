# MC-Bedrock-GameOverlay
This Repo is now **archived**, because the functionality will eventually be added to [ShortDevelopment/MC-Manager](https://github.com/ShortDevelopment/MC-Manager).   
   
Overlay for Minecraft Bedrock   
Currently a "map" with player and their names on it   
The data is obtained by using WebSockets (`/connect localhost:3000`)
